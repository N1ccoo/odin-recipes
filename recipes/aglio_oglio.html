    Spaghetti aglio e olio translates to “spaghetti with garlic and oil.” The traditional dish contains little more than 
    these ingredients. It might be finished with a sprinkle of parsley or a pinch of red pepper flakes, 
    but even these are optional. In its simplest form, this classic Italian pasta features spaghetti, olive oil, garlic, salt, and pepper.

    Ingredients
</h1>
    <ul>
            <li><bold>Spaghetti:</bold> If you don’t have spaghetti on hand, use whatever pasta you do have. I recommend choosing a long pasta like fettuccine, linguine, 
                or bucatini, but if short-cut pasta is what’s in your kitchen, it’ll still come out delicious.</li>
            <li><bold>Olive oil:</bold> Use the best one you have.</li>
            <li><bold>Garlic:</bold> The star ingredient! Don’t skimp on it – it’s essential for infusing the pasta with rich, nutty flavor.</li>
            <li><bold>Red pepper flakes:</bold> For heat! If you’re sensitive to spice, feel free to skip them, or start with just 1/4 teaspoon. 
                If you want your pasta to have more of a kick, add up to 1/2 teaspoon.</li>
                <li><bold>Parsley:</bold> Sprinkle it over the pasta for a lovely fresh finish.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><b>First, cook the pasta. </b>
            Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta until al dente. Reserve some of the starchy pasta water before you drain it!</li>
        <li><b>Next, toast the garlic and red pepper flakes. </b>
            Heat the oil in a large skillet and add the garlic slices and red pepper flakes. 
            Cook until the garlic is fragrant and lightly browned around the edges.</li>
        <li><b>Then, add the kale. </b>
            Toss it with the garlic oil and cook until it wilts.</li>
        <li><b>Finally, stir in the pasta, </b>
            along with the lemon juice and zest and a splash of the reserved pasta water. 
            Toss to combine, adding more pasta water, as needed, to create a light sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste. That’s it!</li>

    </ol>
